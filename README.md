# HacknetSharp

[![.NET Build](https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetSharp/workflows/.NET%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetSharp/actions?workflow=.NET+Build)

This project aims to deliver a multiplayer [Hacknet](http://hacknet-os.com/) experience
to WILLs everywhere.

This project was started purely because tarche created
[HacknetPlusPlus](https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetPlusPlus).
All the WILL homies are having fun making their own
Hacknet, it's almost like Hackerjam 3 except nobody wins this time.

Server implementation hasn't been tested nor is it anywhere near
feature complete, there's even less of a warranty on this than
the standard "none." As a wise Jedi once said, "Don't try it."

## Client

`hsh` is the main terminal client. It supports .NET 5 ([install .NET 5 runtime here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)).

[Read about how to use the client here.](meta/usage-client.md)

## Server

`hss` is the main server program. It supports .NET 5
([install .NET 5 **SDK** here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)). It can use a SQLite or PostgreSQL
backing database.
