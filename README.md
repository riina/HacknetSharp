# HacknetSharp
 Like HacknetPlusPlus but C#

Heavily inspired by the legendary game [Hacknet](http://hacknet-os.com/),
this project aims to deliver a multiplayer Hacknet experience
to WILLs everywhere.

This project was started purely because tarche created [HacknetPlusPlus](https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetPlusPlus).
All the WILL homies are having fun making their own
Hacknet, it's almost like Hackerjam 3 except nobody wins this time.

Server implementation hasn't been tested nor is it anywhere near
feature complete, there's even less of a warranty on this than
the standard "none." As a wise Jedi once said, "Don't try it."

## Client

`hsh` is the main terminal client. It supports .NET Framework 4.7.2
and .NET 5 ([install .NET 5 runtime here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)).

[Read about how to use the client here.](meta/usage-client.md)

## Server

`hss` is the main server program. It can use a SQLite or PostgreSQL
backing database. It supports .NET 5
([install .NET 5 **SDK** here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)).
